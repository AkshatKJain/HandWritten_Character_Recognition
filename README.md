# HandWritten Character Recognition
In this machine learning project, we will recognize handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z. This we are going to achieve by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

The dataset for this project is taken from kaggle which contains 372450 images of alphabets of 28Ã—2, all present in the form of a CSV file-
